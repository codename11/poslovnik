A web based phone book application
It's simple as using your contacts app in your mobile phone.
In first tab/link you type name(required), lastname(required), 
phone number up to 10 digits and choose a type of phone is associated with phone number
fiksni(corded phone) or mobilni(mobile)
In second tab/link you can either just browse your contact list by pressing "Pošalji" button which shows your contacts in a table.
If you type specific name,lastname, number or a type of phone 
you'll get filtered answer i.e if you type specific name it will show you all persons with that name who have phone number in contacts.
In this that you can also sort given by name ascending(ime rastuće), name descending(ime opadajuće), lastname ascending(prezime rastuće), 
lastname descending(prezime opadajuće), number ascending(broj rastuće) and number descending(broj opadajuće).
Later i'm going to try adding a picture for every contact to be "uploadable" when entering new contact. 
That, so long i not forgot about it or if i have time for it that is ...
